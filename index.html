            <p>My name is Vitaliy, I'm from Kazakhstan. I graduated from Polytechnic college (Karagandy, Kazakhstan) in 2009, then graduated with Engineer Degree in Computer Science from TUSUR University (Tomsk, Russia) in 2013.</p>
            <p>At the university and even in my college years I took part in many activities. I was organizer of conferences in my home town, it called "Terricon valley".</p>
            <p>I have huge experience in Information Technologies. I worked in several startups, developed electronic payment system from scratch, worked in international well-known company EPAM.</p>
            <p>My passion for programming started when I was in school. I started developing web sites when I was 14. But now I'm a little bit tired of it, a little bit bored.</p>

            <p>I want to do this program because I want to change my career path. My goal in life is to be useful to others, for me that is the ultimate success. I study to become useful, to develop skills that others need.</p>
            <p>My native language is Russian, but also I speak English, using it for my work everyday, Kazakh Proficient, just started learning Finnish.</p>

            <p>Since I was a little child I wanted to travel and I already have several experiences in foreign countries and cultures. I've been in China, Germany, Switzerland and lot of others but never been in Finland. I still want to do something challenging.</p>
            <p>I would like to take part in this program and work abroad, because this is an excellent opportunity to improve my professional skills and to gain a lot of experiences.</p>
            <p>I am able to work alone or as a part of a team, and I like working with people. I am flexible and open minded, and if it's needed I enjoy organizing different tasks. I am able to work hard, and I love a new challenges. I am alse eager to learn a new things. I think, I could build up good relationship in my profession, and a personal life also.</p>
            <p>What I value highest is the location, as I have wanted to go live in Finland for years. I am just a beginner learner of Finnish. This is an opportunity to improve it. Living in Helsinki for a year would be a dream come true. I am impressed by the school’s international rankings and the praise of the former students. It ensures me that the school will propel my career in the right direction. The curriculum is exactly what I am looking for, as it will give me many different career options. The focus on entrepreneurship interests me, because despite I am engineer I am also a creative person who constantly tries to think outside of the box.</p>
            
            <p>I think that education in Finland is one of the best in the world. I would like to continue studying in the magistracy in Finland.</p>
            <p>I am impressed by the school's international rankings and the praise of the former students.</p>
            <p>I want to do this program because I feel some gap in my knowlegements. I already have huge background in Information Technologies, but I want to explore marketing basics, how sells works, what customers need, etc. I feel that it would be useful for me in future.</p>
            <p>I have an unlimited passion for learning. The desire to learn skills that are useful to others drives me and motivates me.</p>
            <p>When I found this program I was especially glad to know that not only young people could take a part of it.</p>
            <p>It's really good chance to have such rare experience.</p>
            <p>I am have a keen interest in Finland history, so additional benefit for me would be ability to learn Finnish using communication with native speakers. I already started learning it when I moved to Saint-Petersburg, but here is not so much possibilites to practice it.</p>
            <p>I want to develop myself and be useful for others. I can contribute with leadership abilities. I tend to take charge in social and professional situations based on my work as a teamleader in electronic payment system in Kazakhstan.</p>

            <p>I think of technologies and programming like as art. I like beuty architecture decisions and feel difference between good code and code which need refactoring.</p>
            <p>I like self-documented code. Knowledge is power, experience is the way to knowledge.</p>
            <p>I think every tool must have a usecase and vise versa. So when I choose some library I think about what problem I want to solve.</p>
            <p>I read specifications and source code of used libraries to understand deeper technologies I use. I have a good grasp of HTML and CSS applied to application redesign.</p>
            <p>Sharing knowledge is valuable for me: I was leading junior developers, interviewing, doing code reviews. I write articles on Medium and prepare talks from time to time as I am interested in continuous self-development and professional growth. I would like dig deeper in DDD and architecture.</p>
